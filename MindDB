Overview

[Use the overview to provide a brief summary of the reason for the proposal, and how you can best support the client’s needs. You can expand on this summary throughout the rest of the proposal.]

TECHSMART INTERNATIONAL is pleased to submit this proposal for services to support <Client’s Company> in achieving its goals for improving customer satisfaction by <providing training and post-sales support for its new order entry and fulfillment system. We have partnered with dozens of small businesses throughout the Northeast—businesses committed to improving the customer experience through convenience, accuracy of orders, and timely delivery.>
The Objective

[Include a purpose statement that covers the problem and the key theme around your solution. Restate the client’s needs as determined by reading their RFP or your previous interview process.]

<Need #1: improve response time for customer questions >
<Need #2: improve upon weaknesses in upsell/cross-sell volumes>
<Need #3: rapid training for staff on new system>
The Opportunity

[Include major points and identify the opportunity. Restate the client’s project goals you identified previously (such as via RFP, interview, etc.).]

<Goal #1: Train all CSRs on new system within 6 weeks of go-live date>

Our Proposal

[Provide background information, including a brief background on your company and your understanding of the client’s needs and specific issues to be addressed. You may also choose to include the results of any related research, project history, and additional factors that impact the client’s needs, such as socio-economic trends or impending regulations.
Show your understanding of the benefits the client can expect. For example, describe the risks--what might be lost--if appropriate action is not taken and compare this to the benefits they can achieve with a positive course of action. If applicable, identify potential areas of concern for the client and how you can address them. Such items may be fundamental issues that appear trivial, but are often overlooked by competing proposals.
Describe how your capabilities and proposed solution align with the client’s goals for the project, including how your qualifications can uniquely address the current opportunity.]

<Client’s Company> has a well-deserved reputation for quality customer service. However, faced with changes in distribution systems, economic impacts to transportation and logistics, and limitations that prevent taking full advantage of improvements in technology, <Client’s Company> faces the possibility of decreasing sales revenues due customer perceptions of slow delivery and services.
We have developed solutions to help businesses stay ahead of customer satisfaction trends and propose that <Client’s Company> implement a logistics solution focused on JIT order management and automation of many manual steps in your delivery process. Our solution easily integrates with a wide range of off-the-shelf CRM solutions and can enable <Client’s Company> to fully realize the benefits of improved productivity throughout the entire sales cycle. Most importantly, we provide the training and support for this new solution that ensures your staff can ramp up quickly and realize concrete improvements in sales closure, customer satisfaction, and sales metrics.
